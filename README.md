# **Multi-cloud workshop** #


### Introduction ###

Public clouds are omnipresent these days, but which public cloud provider do you choose?  Can you avoid cloud lock-in?  And if you can, do you really want to avoid this?

In this workshop we will look at how we can easily configure infrastructure into different public cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud and Azure).  Once we have our infrastructure in place we will look at how we can easily deploy application to them.

This workshop is accompanied by a presentation which should give you additional insights and knowlegde required to complete this hands-on part.
